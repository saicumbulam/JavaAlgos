A program running on your machine will broadly require:

1. CPU Time
2. Memory
3. Networking Resources
4. Disk Storage

I/O Bound:
programs spend most of their time waiting for input or output operations
to complete while the CPU sits idle. I/O operations can consist of
operations that write or read from main memory or network interfaces.
Because the CPU and main memory are physically separate a data bus exists
between the two to transfer bits to and fro.
Similarly, data needs to be moved between network interfaces and CPU/memory.
Even though the physical distances are tiny, the time taken to move the data
across is big enough for several thousand CPU cycles to go waste.

Cpu Bound:
Programs which are compute-intensive i.e. program execution requires very
high utilization of the CPU (close to 100%) are called CPU bound programs.
Such programs primarily depend on improving CPU speed to decrease program completion time
