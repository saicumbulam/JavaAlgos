Serial Execution:
Programs are serially executed, once a task gets completed, the next one gets a chance to run.

Concurrency:
Capable of running several programs in overlapping time intervals.

Parallelism:
A parallel system executes multiple programs at the same time.


Concurrency vs Parallelism
A concurrent system need not be parallel, whereas a parallel system is indeed concurrent.
Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
