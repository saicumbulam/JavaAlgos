Synchronized:
Synchronized blocks allow only one object to enter and exit. Means a single thread can access the
method/class or the block on which synichronized is applied

diff ways to do synchronize:
1. methods:
class Counter
{
    public synchronized void add(int value)
    {

    }
}

2. class:
class Counter
{
    public Counter(int value)
    {
        synchronized(Counter.class)
        {

        }
    }
}

3. Synchronize on objects
synchronized(Variable)
{

}


Volatile:
Volatile in a variable spcifies jvm to save the value of variable in main memory
than keeping it in cache during run time.

This is to avoid sync problems during multi threading

volatile int count = 0;
